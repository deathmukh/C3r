# C3R

This is my 3D physics simulation project, C3r built using React, Three.js, and Cannon.js! This project provides a fun and interactive scene where users can experiment with various physics concepts in a browser environment.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Utilizes Cannon.js to provide realistic 3D physics simulations.
- **React Integration**: Built with React for easy component-based organization and state management.
- **Interactive Scene**: Users can interact with objects and observe their behavior in the physics simulation.
- **Follow-Up Camera**: Implements a follow-up camera feature to track the movement of objects.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:


2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd c3r
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the simulation.

## Scene Overview

- **Camera Angles**: The scene includes various camera angles to provide different perspectives for users. You can switch between camera angles to observe the simulation from different viewpoints.
- **Track**: The track element provides a surface for objects to move upon. Users can customize the track's shape, material, and obstacles.
- **Ground**: The ground element serves as the base of the scene. Users can customize the ground's texture, material, and properties.

## Credits

- **Cannon.js**: A lightweight 3D physics engine for the web.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library that makes WebGL simpler.
